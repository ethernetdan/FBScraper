# Facebook Scraper

This is the begining of a set of tools to scrape Facebook and store data offline. Right now only Facebook group members have been implemented.

More to come :)

### Group Members
To use the scraper:
* start an instance of MongoDB 
* Set the group name and Facebook cookie in the script (you can get this from Chrome DevTools)
* Run the script (Python 3)

When I get a chance I'll properly package it, but for now you need pymongo and beautifulsoup4
